"""
Given two permutations p and q of length n. Find a permutation r, such that for every 1 <= i <= n, q[i] = p[r[i]].
Permutation of length n is an array consisting of distinct numbers from 1 to n in some order.

Example
Input:
p = [5, 1, 3],  q = [3, 1, 5]

Output:
r = [3, 2, 1]
[input] array.integer p
[input] array.integer q
[output] array.integer
permutation r
