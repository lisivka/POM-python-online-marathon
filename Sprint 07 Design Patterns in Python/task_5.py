Imagine we are studying an organizational structure which consists of General Managers,
Managers, and Developers. A General Manager may have many Managers working under him
and a Manager may have many developers under him. Suppose, you have to determine the total salary of all the employees.

One of the best solutions to the above-described problem is using Composite Method by working with
a common interface that declares a method for calculating the total salary.

Note.
We attempt to make an organizational hierarchy with sub-organization,
which may have subsequent sub-organizations, such as:
GeneralManager                                   [Composite]
      Manager1                                   [Composite]
              Developer11                        [Leaf]
              Developer12                        [Leaf]
      Manager2                                   [Composite]
              Developer21                        [Leaf]
              Developer22                        [Leaf]
